# Contributing to Ethereum Obituaries
We appreciate your interest in contributing to the Ethereum Obituaries project. This document outlines how to add a new obituary and how to contribute to the website.

## Part 1: How to Add a New Obituary

### Guidelines for contributing new obituaries
- **Verify the content:** Ensure that the link you want to add explicitly states that the Ethereum project is failing, ending, over, killed, outclassed, dead, overtly bearish,going to crash, or going to zero either in the post title or in its contents.

- **Avoid duplicates:** Search previous entries before making a new one to avoid duplicates.

- **One entry per PR:** Add only one new obituary entry per Pull Request.

- **Twitter/X/Social Media posts:** For Twitter posts to be included, the account must have more than 5000 followers at the time of the post.

- **Link validity:** Ensure the provided link is working and points to the original source. Replace it by a screenshot if you fear it might get removed/archived.

### Where to add new obituaries
1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository locally.
3. Create a new branch for your contribution.
4. Locate the `ethereum-obituaries.json` file in the project.

     "statement": "The exact statement declaring Ethereum's demise",
     "author": "Name of the author",
     "source": "Publication or platform name",
     "link": "URL to the original article or post",
   }
6. Ensure the entry is in the correct chronological order within the JSON file.
